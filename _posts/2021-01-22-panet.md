description: Enhance feature hierarchy by bottom-up path augmentation, which shortens the information path between lower layers and topmost feature.

Features from low levels are helpful for large instances, but there is a long path from low levels to topmost features. Mask prediction is made in a single view losing the chance to gather more diverse info.

Enhance FPN with bottom up path augmentation to enhance the localization capability of the entire feature hierarchy. To achive this they built a path with lateral connections from the lwo lewel to top ones. 

FPN proposals are asigned to different feature levels according to the proposal size but it can generate non-optimal results and the importance of features may not be strongly corelated to the levels they belong to. Both allowing small proposals to access high level large receptive features with large receptive fields, and allowing large proposals to access low level features with fine details are beneficial.

They pool features from all levels with adaptive feature pooling: they map each proposal to different feature levels, and use ROIAllign to pool feature grids from each level, and finally a fusion (elementwise sum or max) operation.

The box head uses 2 fc layers for class and box prediction, and the mask head uses fully connected fusion: small FCN predicts a bnary pixelwise mask for each class independently to decouple segmentation and classification and a bottom short path to predict foreground-background path. For the final mask prediction they are addded.
