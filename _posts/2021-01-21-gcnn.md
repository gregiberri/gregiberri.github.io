Use spatially-variant guided image filters instead of conventional convolution. Guidance according to the image (guided image filtering cant work on sparse input according to an old 2010 article). 2 encoder and 2 decoder for the 2 input: image decoder features are used to make generate guided convolutions.

To save computation and memory the guided convolution is factorized into a spatial channelwise and a cross-channel convolution.
