CNN to extract features, then flatten the low res features and use them in a transformer encoder decoder to predict a set. The method does not use anchors (even thou it could be using and probably could give better results) and NMS. Use bipartite matching loss to train the transformer to train the number of objects in the image and match them to the gt (the predictions are matched to the corresponding gt according to a similarity loss).

The results are better than the baseline Faster-RCNN, but the results on small objects are worse.
